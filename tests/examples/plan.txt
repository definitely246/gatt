get a list of all the files and their full paths

we are going to process the entire full path all at once
so we can generate dynamic contexts for "a" inside of "a[]" loop



loop through all names and set dynamic variables

anytime we see { brackets } we will try to parse it

anytime you see an array inside those brackets we need to initialize a loop


a: [
	{
		thing: "foo1",
		b: [
			{ thing: "bar1" },
			{ thing: "baz1" }
		]
	},
	{
		thing: "foo2",
		b: [
			{ thing: "bar2" },
			{ thing: "baz2" }
		]
	},
]



{a[].thing}/{a[].b[].thing}.txt

foo1/bar1.txt
foo1/baz1.txt
foo1/bar2.txt
foo1/baz2.txt

foo2/bar1.txt
foo2/baz1.txt
foo2/bar2.txt
foo2/baz2.txt


{a[].thing}/{a.b[].thing}.txt

foo1/bar1.txt
foo1/baz1.txt
foo2/bar2.txt
foo2/baz2.txt


{a[].thing}_{a.b[].thing}.txt

foo1_bar1.txt
foo1_baz1.txt
foo2_baz2.txt
foo2_baz2.txt




dynamic temporary context is generated whenever we have arrays []


foreach (somearray as s)
{
	if path is directory go inside
	go inside the directory
}
